# üá©üá™‚Üíüá∑üá∫ German to Bilingual German-Russian EPUB Translator

This tool is built for language learners and enthusiasts who want to convert German-language EPUB files into bilingual German-Russian format. Each sentence is followed by a partial translation, with key words and phrases explained in Russian. This method naturally enhances comprehension and expands vocabulary through context.

**Default behavior:** **German in ‚Üí German-Russian EPUB out**  
Other language pairs can be configured via parameters.

## üìò `book_nllb.py` ‚Äî Main Translation Script


This script converts German EPUBs into bilingual German-Russian EPUBs using:

- **Meta‚Äôs NLLB** for machine translation  
- **KeyBERT** for keyword extraction  
- Inline translation to support contextual learning

> üí° Tip: Use **VS Code** with a **devcontainer** for a consistent development environment.  
> Alternatively, use the traditional workflow:

```bash
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
uv pip install .
python book_nllb.py input.epub output.epub
```

## üóÉÔ∏è `convert_sqlite.py` ‚Äî Vocabulary Support Script

This script loads German nouns from a JSON file into an SQLite database.  
It's useful in combination with `book_nllb.py` for word lookups and vocabulary review.

Reference file:  
[german_nouns_output.json](https://github.com/Hanttone/der-die-das-game/blob/master/data/german_nouns_output.json)

## ü§ñ `book_gemma.py` ‚Äî Experimental Translation Script

An alternative translation method using **Gemma 3** via **Ollama**.

- Outputs bilingual German-Russian translation in JSON format
- Generates word frequency statistics
- Allows filtering and selective translation
- Designed for experimentation; not optimized for production use

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Demo code only ‚Äî no setup or containerization included.

### üîß Build the Executable Yourself

If you'd rather build it manually:

1. On Windows: run `build_executable.bat`  
2. On macOS/Linux: run `./build_executable.sh`  
   (Make it executable first: `chmod +x build_executable.sh`)

For release instructions, see [RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md](RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md).

### üõ†Ô∏è Tips ###
*   Use `uv` for fast environment setup (`uv venv && uv sync`).
*   Use VS Code Dev Containers for a pre-built environment.
*   Setup your huggegingface token
*   PyTorch inside the container works smoothly with CUDA if the GPU supports it. Locally, you might need to tweak drivers and versions.
